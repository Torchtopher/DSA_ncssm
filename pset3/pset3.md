# Problem Set 3 Lab

In this lab, you will extend a codebase to incorporate a Binary Search Tree (BST). Your
BST must implement all methods so that both the main program **and** the BSTTester work.

## Files Changed
* `WorkSpace.java` - new; contains multiple DrawingSpaces
* `LList.java` - soln for PSet 2
* `DrawerApp` - use WorkSpace instead of DrawingSpace
* `BSTree.java` - Scaffold for the Binary Search Tree (**PSet 3 Base Tier**)
* `BSTester.java` - Testing the Binary Search Tree with Integers
* `Explorer.java` - new; contains a list of DrawingSpace names and the ability to sort the names

## Setup
1. Download the base project and open it in IntelliJ.
2. Change the package to incorporate your name (edu.ncssm.`username`)
3. Read through the code and investigate the BSTree class.  You will need to implement all the public methods.
4. Add appropriate JavaDoc and comments throughout the BSTree class


## Implementation Details
* I have declared all the public methods and inner classes needed for this lab.  You are not permitted to alter any public signatures without permission. You may add any private elements you need.
* **NEVER** return a `BSTNode` or have it as a parameter type of public method.
* BSTs need not be optimized, but you should reduce duplicate code.
* All non-private methods must have proper JavaDoc comments, and you must include comments with code that is not self-documenting.  I have purposefully not commented the BSTree file.

## Rubric (Base Tier)
* Style/Documentation
    * Variable, Method, and Class names
    * Commenting and JavaDoc
* Method Implementation
    * Constructors - Use Natural Ordering unless a Comparator is provided.
    * `add` - Correctly insert data into the BST 
    * `remove` - Remove the **first** instance of data from the BST (handles zero, one, and two children) 
    * `removeAll` - Remove **all** instances of data from the BST
    * Traversals - Pre-, Post-, and In-Order traversals must work

## Additional Tiers (Complete 2 of 3 for a Late Day)
1. Add the ability to handle global key events:
    1. ESC - deselect all objects
    2. Delete - delete the selected objects
2. Add the ability to move the selected shape
    1. Arrow keys
    2. Click and drag with the mouse after the shape is built
3. Add a custom tool (rectangle/circle) and provide a way to switch between tools
